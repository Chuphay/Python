    "As is well known [see Jackson for example] is that light is linearly additive. While the speed of light remains absolute, adding two waves of light can have two effects. One, if the light beams are traveling in the same direction, then their momentums will add which, usually means the intensity of the light will add, but somehow, {I guess this is part of the gizmo}, we assume that instead of adding to the intensity of the light, the frequency content of the light wave can change to compensate for the difference of energy. i.e., a photon, which does not really have an intensity bombarded with another photon, will increase its frequency content. To prove this on a very sound level we will need quantum mechanics.\n",

    "Two, if the light beams are traveling in different directions, then a new beam, will be essentially created that goes in the direction of both beams. I think this is easy to visualize. Imagine two streams of water combining that are not going in the exact same direction. The combined stream will go in a direction that is a sum of the two streams.\n",

We imagine a light ray that emanates from a distant star that passes close-by the massive object that will distort the fields and then travels beyond the star. We say that at the closest point while passing, is at a distance of b. For calculations reasons, it will be simplest to say that both where the light emmanates from and where it is finally observed are infinitely far away from the massive object.\n",
