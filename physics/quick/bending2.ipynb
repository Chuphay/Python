We say that the closest point while passing, i.e. the impact parameter, is at a distance of b. For calculations reasons, it will be simplest to say that both the observer and the point of emmanation are infinitely far away from the massive object.\n",

We then simply integrate along the straight-line path of the light ray, and keep track of how much deviation there is in the momentum. Because of symmetry, we can calculate the change in momentum in the direction perpendicular to the direction of travel, using the following integration:\n",
