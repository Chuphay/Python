me destroy you.  You do not yet

If you only knew the power of the 
dark side.  Obi-Wan never told 
you what happened to your father.

who killed him.

That's impossible!
Search your feelings.  You know 
it to be true.
No!
Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
He has foreseen this.  It is your 
destiny.  Join me, and together 
we can rule the galaxy as father 
and son.  Come with me.  It is the 
only way.
