CHER V.O.



So OK, you're probably thinking, "Is this, like
a Noxema commercial, or what?!" But seriously, I actually have a way
normal life for a teenage girl. I mean I get up, I brush my teeth, and
I pick out my school clothes.




"Fashion Girl"
David Bowie




Daddy's a litigator. Those are the scariest kinds
of lawyers. Even Lucy, our maid, is terrified of him. He's so good he gets
paid five hundred dollars an hour just to fight with people, but he fights
with me for free 'cause I'm his daughter.




CHER




Daddy!




MEL




Cher, please don't start with the juice again.




CHER




Daddy, you need your vitamin C.




MEL




Where's my briefcase?




CHER




It's been a couple of months now, so I say we go out
to Malibu.




MEL




Don't tell me those braindead low-lifes have been
calling again.




CHER




They are your parents. And don't try sneaking out
of the office. Dr. Lovitz is coming by to give you a flu shot.




MEL




Oh, Josh is in town. He's coming for dinner.




CHER




Why?




MEL




Because he's your step-brother!




CHER




But you were hardly even married to his mother and
that was five years ago. Why do I have to see Josh?




(Watch those LIPS!!)



MEL




You divorce wives, not children.




CHER




Here.




MEL




Forget it!




SCENE II - CHER'S CAR



"Just a girl" No
Doubt



CHER V.O.




Did I show you the loqued-out Jeep Daddy got me? It's
got four wheel drive, dual side airbags and monster sound system. I don't
have a licence yet, but I need something to learn on.




(Cher runs over a potted plant
on the kerb)




Oh, why that came out of nowhere.




(Watch her face when she looks
back at the road)




Here's where Dionne lives. She's my friend because
we both know what it's like to have people be jealous of us.




DIONNE




Dude!




CHER




Girlfriend!




CHER V.O.




And I must give her snaps for her courageous fashion
efforts.




DIONNE




Hey Cher.




CHER V.O. 




Dionne and I were both named after great singers of
the past who now do infomercials.




DIONNE




So?




CHER




Shopping with Dr. Seuss?




DIONNE




Well, at least I wouldn't skin a Collie to make my
backpack.




CHER




It's Faux.




DIONNE




Hello. That was a stop sign!




CHER




I totally paused!




DIONNE




Yeah, OK.




SCENE III - SCHOOL WALKWAY



DIONNE




It's not even eight thirty and Murray is paging me.




CHER




He is so possesive.




DIONNE




Tell me about it. This weekend he called me up and
he's all "Where were you today?" and I'm like "I'm at my
Grandmother's house"...




CHER V.O.




Dionne and her boyfriend, Murray are in this dramatic
relationship. I think they've seen that Ike and Tina Turner movie just
too many times. Now I have to say to her...




CHER




Dee, why do you put up with it? You could do so much
better.




DIONNE




Alright, sh, sh. Here he comes.




"Shoop" Salt n'
Pepa



MURRAY




Woman, why don't you be answering any of my pages?




DIONNE




I hate when you call me Woman!




MURRAY




Where you been all weekend? What's up? You been jeepin'
around behind my back?




DIONNE




Jeepin'?




CHER




Jeepin'.




(Watch Cher closely. It's Classic!)



MURRAY




Jeepin', jeepin'.




DIONNE




No, but speaking of vehicular sex, perhaps you can
explain to me how this cheap K-mart hair extension got into the back seat
of your car.




MURRAY




I don't know where that came from. That looks like
one of your stringy something on others you got up here...




DIONNE




Excuse me. I do not wear polyester hair, OK. Unlike
some people I know, like Shawanna.




CHER




Dee, I'm outie.




DIONNE




Bye.




MURRAY




Why do you gotta go there?




DIONNE




That's it. I've had it with you.




MURRAY




Is it that time of the month again?




(Croud Gasps)



CHER V.O.




I don't know why Dionne is going out with a high school
boy. They're like dogs. You have to clean them and feed them and they're
just like these nervous creatures that jump and slobber all over you.




(Random guy puts his arm around
Cher)



CHER 




Ooo! Get off of me! Uh, AS IF!




SCENE IV - CLASSROOM DEBATE



MR HALL




Should all oppressed people be allowed refuge in America?
Amber will take the con position. Cher will be pro. Cher, two minutes.




CHER 




So, OK, like right now, for example, the Haitians
need to come to America. But some people are all "What about the strain
on our resources?" But it's like, when I had this garden party for
my father's birthday right? I said R.S.V.P. because it was a sit-down dinner.
But people came that like, did not R.S.V.P. so I was like, totally
buggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish
in extra place settings, but by the end of the day it was like, the more
the merrier! And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange
some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion,
may I please remind you that it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of
Liberty?




(Class breaks into applause)



CHER




Thank you very much.




MR HALL




Uh, Amber? Replying?




AMBER




Mr. Hall, how can I answer that? The topic is Haiti
and she's talking about some little party.




CHER




Hello?! It was his fiftieth birthday!




AMBER




Whatever. If she doesn't do the assignment, I can't
do mine.




MR HALL




Ladies. So, does anyone have any further thoughts
on Cher's oration? Elton? Comments?




ELTON




Yeah, I can't find my Cranberries CD. I've gotta do
to the Quad before somebody snags it.




MR HALL




I'm afraid I can't permit that. Any further insights?




TRAVIS




I had an insight, Mr. Hall.




MR HALL




I'm all ears.




TRAVIS




OK, like, the way I feel about the Rolling Stones
is the way my kids are going to feel about Nine Inch Nails, so I really
shouldn't torment my Mom anymore, huh?




MR HALL




Yes. Well, it's a little off the subject of Haiti,
but tolerance is always a good lesson, even when it comes out of nowhere.




TRAVIS




Thank you.




MR HALL




And with that in mind, I'm going to distribute you
report cards. Now, is there a Christian Stobich in this class?




CHER




MR. Hall? The buzz on Christian is that his parents
have joint 
custody, so he'll be spending one semester in Chicago
and one semester here. I think it is a travesty on the part of the legal
profession.




(Look at Cher's face while speaking!
Ahhh, I can't take it anymore!)



MR HALL




Thank you for that perspective Cher.




(Mr. Hall hands out the report
cards)




Now could all conversations please come to a halt.




(Travis jumps up to the window)




And could the suicide attempts please be postponed
till the next period?




TRAVIS




Must die.




(After Cher, the most classic
character in the movie)



CHER V.O.




Suddenly, a dark cloud settled over first period.
I got a C in debate?!




SCENE V - SCHOOL HALLWAY



CHER (on phone)




Dee?




DIONNE




Wassup?




CHER




Did you get your report card?




DIONNE




Yeah, I'm toast. How'd you do?




CHER




I totally choked. My father is going to go ballistic
on me.




DIONNE




Mr. Hall was way harsh!




(Cher and Dionne meet up in
the hall)




He gave me a C minus.




CHER




Well, he gave me a C, which drags down my entire average.




DIONNE




Bye.




CHER




I'll call ya, OK?




DIONNE




Yeah.




SCENE VI - CHER'S HOUSE



CHER V.O.




Isn't my house classic? The columns date all the way
back to 1972. Wasn't my Mom a betty? She died when I was just a baby. A
fluke accident during a routine liposuction. I don't remember her, but
I like to pretend she still watches over me.




CHER




Hey, Ma. 98 in geometry. Pretty groovy, huh?




"Fake Plastic Trees
(Acoustic Version)" Radiohead



CHER V.O. 




Yuk! Uh, the maudlin music of the University station.




CHER




Waa, waa, waa.
